Goal: Today, since my partner is absent, I will research the required front
end elements of a chatroom.

Accomplished: At the end of class today, I figured out that I will need to revisit
CSS and HTML over the next few days or weeks, or however long it takes
for me to understand it to a point where I can infuse it with AJAX, PHP,
SQL, JavaScript and possibly Java. For tomorrow, I will work on the basics
of CSS and try to rebuild the foundation that I need to succeed on this 
project.

Goal: Today, my group will need to redefine the project specifications
because Mr. Nockles said that the current project will be too easy.

Accomplished: We decided that we will work solely on Java instead of using
multiple languages. We will add voice interface to the chatroom to ad
complexity and implement it on Vaadin as well. For the weekend, we
all are going to watch a set of videos on YouTube
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr02nyPqLBU)  to understand how the
chatroom works. On Monday, we will divide the roles after having a 
better understanding. We will also need to research how create a server
host and how to have voice in Java.
