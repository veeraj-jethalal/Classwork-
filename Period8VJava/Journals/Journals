Goal: Today, since my partner is absent, I will research the required front
end elements of a chatroom.

Accomplished: At the end of class today, I figured out that I will need to revisit
CSS and HTML over the next few days or weeks, or however long it takes
for me to understand it to a point where I can infuse it with AJAX, PHP,
SQL, JavaScript and possibly Java. For tomorrow, I will work on the basics
of CSS and try to rebuild the foundation that I need to succeed on this 
project.

Goal: Today, my group will need to redefine the project specifications
because Mr. Nockles said that the current project will be too easy.
