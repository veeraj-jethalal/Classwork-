Goal: Today, since my partner is absent, I will research the required front
end elements of a chatroom.

Accomplished: At the end of class today, I figured out that I will need to revisit
CSS and HTML over the next few days or weeks, or however long it takes
for me to understand it to a point where I can infuse it with AJAX, PHP,
SQL, JavaScript and possibly Java. For tomorrow, I will work on the basics
of CSS and try to rebuild the foundation that I need to succeed on this 
project.

Goal: Today, my group will need to redefine the project specifications
because Mr. Nockles said that the current project will be too easy.

Accomplished: We decided that we will work solely on Java instead of using
multiple languages. We will add voice interface to the chatroom to ad
complexity and implement it on Vaadin as well. For the weekend, we
all are going to watch a set of videos on YouTube
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr02nyPqLBU) to understand how the
chatroom works. On Monday, we will divide the roles after having a 
better understanding. We will also need to research how create a server
host and how to have voice in Java.

        5/8/17
        
Goal: Today, I will do research on how to add voice in Java.

Accomplished: I learned that there is a Java Voice Recognition API which
can be implemented into our code to enable voice chat in addition to 
an ordinary chat room. We also found an example of how to implement
this API. I will not be in class tomorrow because of my Calculus BC AP
Exam, and I will not be in class on 5/10/17 because of my Economics AP 
Exam. I will coordinate with my group and try to do my part at home, but 
for today, I need to finish watching the videos from the weekend.

        5/11/17
        
Goal: Today, I will explore Vaadin and think of ways I can improve the basic
chatbot as well as finishing the playlist of videos.

Accomplished: We concluded that we will not be using Vaadin anymore. I also
finished watching the videos and gained a better understanding of my role and
what the final product should look like. Tomorrow, I will think of ways
to make the chatbot a program that does more than just instant messaging.

        5/12/17
        
Goal: Today, I will look for ways in which I can add onto the chatroom.

Accomplished: I thought I would be able to add video chatting, but I realized
that will not be possible. I decided to stick with designing the front end
and allowing the user the customize the color, size and type of their message.
I will also try to implement small things, such as allowing the user to
see when the other user is typing or when the user saw the message, like on
Facebook.
